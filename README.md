# HTML Basics

This repository documents my daily practice of HTML fundamentals.
I started with pure HTML structure and gradually improved the page
to understand real-world usage.

## Files
- index.html  
  Main page with improved structure and links to CSS and JavaScript.

- html-basics.html  
  Pure HTML-only version created during initial practice.

## Topics Covered
- HTML document structure
- Semantic tags (header, section, footer)
- Forms and input elements
- Lists and tables

## Purpose
This project is part of my daily GitHub contributions to strengthen
frontend fundamentals and maintain consistent practice.
